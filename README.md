BLDC motors represent an opportunity for massive improvements in hobby 
robotics work, but is largely limited by the cost. You can get a 
serviceable motor for less than $5, but the driver to use it starts at 
$40. The goal for this project is to create an open-source 100W BLDC 
servo controller design with a BOM cost under $10 and an accompanying 
library for control to standardize open-source FOC work.
